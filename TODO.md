TODO most important
	some kind of good management for media downlodaing

	like be able to hover over a link and press a simple binding q or something easy,
	and it will do something with that link like add it to /tmp/0

- ad block?
	actually unclear if you really need this or if cosmetic filtering is
	sufficient

	how often do you really use any ad-ridden sites these days? like random
	recipe articles, you simply would never consider given the state of LLM
	search

- simple tab bar

- general bindings for switching tabs etc

- editing a textarea inside kakoune remotely
	maybe a binding for that
